= Guillotine - GraphQL Headless CMS for Enonic XP
:toc

== Introduction

Once assigned to your site, the guillotine application will generate dynamically a powerful GraphQL API that enables web-based access to all 
your editorial content.

Guillotine exposes the read-only part of the Enonic Content API, including access to the Enonic query language. 
Guillotine dynamically analyzes all available content types in the site and automatically generates a GraphQL API specific to your site. 
This gives you direct, typed and documented access to all content within the site. Including the ability to follow references, 
child items and access media directly.

The Guillotine API adds a new service to your site in the following path relative to the site root: /_/service/com.enonic.app.guillotine/graphql 

The fastest way to explore the Guillotine API is by adding Guillotine to an existing site (or a demo site from Enonic Market), 
then install [GraphiQL](https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/graphiql) and point it to your local site url + service path as defined above.

== Usage

==== TBD

The GraphQL service URL from one of your configured site should already be filled in the field 'Service Location'.

* The left part of GraphiQL is used to write your graphQL query
* The center part of GraphiQL is used to display the result of these queries
* The right part of GraphiQL is used to display a documentation generated from the GraphQL API.

==== Example 1: Display current content display name

* Send a query to retrieve the display name and type of the current content

----
{
  content {
    get {
      displayName
      type
    }
  }
