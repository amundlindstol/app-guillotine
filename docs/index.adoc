= Guillotine application

Once assigned to your site, 
the guillotine application will generate a dynamic GraphQL API that enables web-based access to all your editorial content.

Guillotine exposes the read-only part of the Enonic Content API, including access to the Enonic query language. 
Guillotine dynamically analyzes all available content types in the site and generates a GraphQL API specific to your site. 
This gives you direct, typed and documented access to all content within the site. Including the ability to follow references, 
child items and access media directly.


[NOTE]
==== 
GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook. 
This technology allows Guillotine to provide a single and exhaustive API 
while allowing you to retrieve all the content information you need in one request without any superfluous information

== Usage

Once a site is configured with the Guillotine application, a service "graphql" is present under the site path. 
Example: "http://localhost:8080/mysite/mypage/_/service/com.enonic.app.guillotine/graphql".

=== GraphiQL

The easiest way to manually explore a GraphQL API and test GraphQL queries is to use GraphiQL

=== Client

To use your GraphQL service, your client will send all its requests to the same service.
The service is expecting to receive a POST request with inside its body:

* A mandatory "query" String
* An optional "variables" Object

==== Example: Generate a service URL from a controller

[source,javascript]
----
var portalLib = require('/lib/xp/portal');
var graphqlServiceUrl = portalLib.serviceUrl({
    service: 'graphql'
});
----

==== Example: Fetch data from client javascript
[source,javascript]
----
const query = `query($path:ID!){
    guillotine {
        get(key:$path) {
            displayName
            type
        }
    }
}`;

const variables = {
    'path': '/mycontentpath'
};

fetch('{{graphqlServiceUrl}}', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        query: query,
        variables: variables
    }),
    credentials: 'same-origin'
})
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(console.log);
