= Release Notes

== Version 6

WARNING: This release includes <<breaking_changes, breaking changes>>

=== Release features

Project level API:: The Guillotine app now mounts to the root of all projects - automatically provisioning an API to all project branches root i.e. `/site/<myproject>/<branch>`.

Dynamic site context:: With the API now being project-relative, setting the site context in a header enable you to <<usage#site_context, perform site relative queries>>.

Global schema:: The GraphQL type schema is generated from all available schemas (across all installed apps) in the Enonic instance.

Content Studio API browser:: Guillotine also features an embedded GraphQL API browser called <<clients#query_playground, Query playground>>. Query Playground is available directly in Content Studio, in context of your projects.

Typed x-data schemas:: Like for all other schemas, x-data are now also fully typed - grouped by application key. See <<usage#xdata, examples of xData usage>>

=== Breaking changes

Site deployment removed:: You may no longer add this application to a site, and get a contextual API. Use the <<usage#site_context, site context header>>, or <<embed#, embed Guillotine>> in your application to replicate this functionality.

ItemSet and OptionSet type name fix:: Previously, their types were erroneously generated from their schema label, rather than name. Clients using these types through introspection will break if label and name are different in the schemas.
